# Processing-Color-Tracker
A colour tracking system that uses MJPEG Streams to track colors

Still in development, I want to add a few more features such as:
<li> - [MAYBE] OCR</li>
<li> - A smaller viewer of of each detected color</li>
<li> - Reduce as much noise and false detections as possible</li>

If you have any ideas that you believe are worth adding, set up an issue!
